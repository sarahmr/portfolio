        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <img src="assets/headshot.jpg" alt="sarah rose" style="height: 200px" />
        <p>My name is Sarah Rose and I'm a full-stack software engineer with Ruby on Rails and React experience. My background is in archival sciences and music history and I've spend most of the past several years working in museums and libraries. While I loved working directly with history, I grew restless with my career path. I wanted to help build the platforms people use to research & create, to be constantly challenged, and I wanted to grow analytically and creatively. The move into software engineering hit all of these points and I'm excited to be here. Take a look at my projects & reach out if you'd like to get in touch.</p>
